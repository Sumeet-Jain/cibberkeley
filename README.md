Setup
=====

1. Make sure you have ruby installed. Version doesn't matter too much. https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/

2. We use [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to build this static website. To install jekyll, simply type
  
    gem install jekyll

3. `jekyll serve` to build and serve the site. From here, you can go to `localhost:4000` to view the site.
